# Lessons Learned
<br>Wow, where to start!?
<br>  This started out fairly difficult, then felt simple. Near the end however, I felt that there were some concepts I didn't grasp. Specifically, topRating method and how a null fleet[] variable was avoided. Now that I have reviewed it in this program I understand it better. I am hopeful that I will be able to predict how a null value in an array will effect operations of that array.
<br> I feel comfortable walking through small steps in plain english with a TA. During this project I often found myself over-complicating the code in a 'shotgun' approach to solve an error.
<br> I failed to commit earlier in my project and wish I had remembered to do so. It would have been nice to see some of the steps I solved.
<br> I can boil down the 3 biggest take away's.
<br>1 . Methods are really helpful in organizing the steps.
<br>2 . While loops and booleans went hand in hand for this particular program.
<br>3 . When the code get's frustrating it's helpful to try to simplify what you are trying to do.
